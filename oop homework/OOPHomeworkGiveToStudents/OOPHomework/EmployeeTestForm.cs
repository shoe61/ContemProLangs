// NAME:  Dr. Stringfellow and Scott Schumacher
// Homework 3 - 10 points        DUE:  Thursday, Oct. 64, 2016
// INSTRUCTIONS:  You are to draw a diagram representing the 
//    inheritance tree.  You are to fill in ALL the ??? in 
//    this file demonstrating you understand polymophism. 
//    In some cases more than one thing will make the program work, 
//    but I want you to USE polymorphism to the fullest!
// TURN IN:  Your tree, this file and a screen dump of the output.

// This program demonstrates polymorphism by displaying earnings
// for various Employee types.using System;
