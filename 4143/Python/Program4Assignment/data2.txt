Harriet Lambchop was making breakfast.  Her husband, George, at
the kitchen table, helped by reading bits from the morning paper.
Here’s an odd one, he said.  here is a chicken in Sweden that rides
a bike.  So do I, said Harriet, not really listening.

When breakfast was ready, Harriet said I will go wake up the boys, to her husband.
Just then their younger son, Arthur, called
from the bedroom he shared with his brother Stanley.

Hey, come and look!

Harriet and George Lambchop were both very much in favor of
politeness and careful speech, Hay is for horses, Arthur,
not people, George said as they entered the bedroom.
